# odin-recipes
This aim of this project is to apply foundational HTML knowledge and build a basic recipe website.
The finished product will be uploaded/pushed to Github.

UPDATE: This was a fun exercise, I feel confident in using the terminal to create directories and files, and opening them. I'm less certain in my understanding on the exact process to create and upload repositories to Github, let alone comprehending the function of Git.
